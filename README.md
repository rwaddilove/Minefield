Minefield

A text-based Terminal version of Minesweeper created as a Python learning exercise. Work in progess - not finished! It's probably not perfect code. As I learn more and better Python, I may return to it and improve it.

Minesweeper dates back to 1990. It was included with Windows for decades and is the best known version. Read the history at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper
